# Ninja Suite

A collection of lightweight, focused tools for developers and power users. Built for people who value speed, simplicity, and getting things done.

## Philosophy

Every tool in Ninja Suite follows the same principles:

- **Fast** - No bloat, instant startup, responsive UI
- **Focused** - Each tool does one thing well
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows and Linux
- **Dark mode** - Easy on the eyes, professional aesthetic
- **Offline-first** - Your data stays yours, works without internet
